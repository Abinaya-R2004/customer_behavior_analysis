# customer_behavior_analysis
This project analyzes customer data to identify purchasing patterns and behavioral trends using Python and SQL. The cleaned data is visualized through an interactive dashboard, enabling clear insights into customer segmentation, spending behavior, and key business metrics to support data-driven decision-making.

📊 Data Analysis Project: End-to-End Analytics Pipeline

📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow using Python, SQL, and Power BI.
The objective is to extract meaningful insights from raw data through exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL-based analysis, and interactive dashboard visualization.

This project highlights practical skills expected from a Data Analyst, including data handling, querying, and business-oriented reporting.

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains structured data related to business/customer/transaction behavior.

Data is initially loaded and analyzed using Python.

Cleaned and transformed data is stored and queried using PostgreSQL.

(Note: Dataset details such as size, features, and source can be added here if public.)

🔄 Project Workflow / Steps
1️⃣ Data Loading

Loaded the dataset into Python using Pandas.

Performed initial inspection (shape, columns, data types).

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distributions, trends, and patterns.

Identified missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

Generated visual insights using plots and charts.

3️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing and duplicate values.

Corrected data types and standardized formats.

Prepared clean data for database storage and analysis.

4️⃣ SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)

Imported cleaned data into PostgreSQL.

Wrote SQL queries using:

SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY

Aggregate functions

Joins and subqueries

Extracted business-level insights using SQL.

5️⃣ Power BI Dashboard

Connected PostgreSQL to Power BI.

Built an interactive dashboard featuring:

Key metrics (KPIs)

Trend analysis

Category-wise and time-based insights

Designed for clarity and decision-making.

📈 Dashboard Highlights

Summary KPIs

Interactive filters and slicers

Visual trends and comparisons

Business-friendly layout
